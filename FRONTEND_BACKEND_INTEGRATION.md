# Frontend-Backend Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate the frontend JSX components with the backend API endpoints. The primary focus was on ensuring field mappings between frontend and backend are handled correctly without changing the core structure of either codebase.

## Key Changes

1. **Service Layer Field Mapping**
   - Added field mapping logic in service layers to handle differences between frontend and backend field names
   - Implemented support for both camelCase and snake_case field formats
   - Created flexible mapping functions to handle various input formats

2. **Model Extensions**
   - Added JSONB fields to store additional frontend data not directly mapped to backend schemas:
     - `metadata` field in Contact model
     - `additionalInfo` field in PartnerApplication model
     - `preferences` field in Newsletter model

3. **Migration Updates**
   - Created a new migration (`009-add-field-mapping-columns.js`) to add the necessary fields to existing tables
   - Added error handling to ensure migrations can be run on both new and existing databases

4. **Path Corrections**
   - Updated import paths in routes and server.js to match the new directory structure
   - Fixed controller references to ensure proper module loading

## Specific Integration Points

### Authentication (Login/Register)

- Registration now handles both `first_name`/`lastName` formats
- User role mapping from frontend `user_type` to backend role system
- Response format includes both naming conventions for maximum compatibility

### Contact Form

- Core fields (name, email, subject, message) mapped directly
- Additional fields (phone, company, website, preferred_contact_method) stored in metadata
- Subject field handles both string and object format from frontend

### Partner Application

- Business/restaurant name field mapping
- Contact/owner name field mapping
- Additional business details stored in structured JSON

### Newsletter

- Added support for subscription preferences
- Added source tracking for analytics
- Implemented preference update logic for existing subscribers

## Documentation

- Created detailed field mapping documentation in `eat-fast-backend/FRONTEND_BACKEND_FIELD_MAPPING.md`
- Added inline code comments explaining the mapping logic
- Updated server.js with proper route imports

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test user registration with both field naming formats
2. Verify login response contains all necessary fields for frontend
3. Submit contact form with additional fields and verify storage
4. Test partner application with various field combinations
5. Test newsletter subscription with and without preferences

## Next Steps

1. Run database migrations to add the new fields
2. Test all forms to ensure proper field mapping
3. Monitor API responses to verify correct data formats
4. Consider adding validation middleware to standardize input formats
